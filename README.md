# FieldnotesLM

Your personal AI-powered research assistant and note-taking tool. This project is an independent implementation inspired by the open-notebook project, customized for your specific needs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 (Currently using this version for maximum stability and compatibility)
- Docker (for database and optional containerized deployment)
- Poetry (for dependency management)

> **Note on Python Version**: This project currently uses Python 3.9 to ensure stability and compatibility with all dependencies. Future upgrades to newer Python versions will be implemented once the ecosystem fully supports it.

## Features

- Multi-Notebook Support for organizing research
- Multi-model support (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI, Open Router, Ollama)
- Podcast Generation from notes
- Broad Content Integration (links, PDFs, EPUB, Office files, YouTube, audio/video)
- AI-Powered Notes
- Integrated Search Engines
- Fine-Grained Context Management

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your environment variables in `.env` or `docker.env`
3. Run using either Docker or local installation

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

```bash
docker compose --profile multi up
```

### Local Setup

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![New Notebook](docs/assets/asset_list.png)


An open source, privacy-focused alternative to Google's Notebook LM. Why give Google more of our data when we can take control of our own research workflows?

In a world dominated by Artificial Intelligence, having the ability to think üß† and acquire new knowledge üí°, is a skill that should not be a privilege for a few, nor restricted to a single provider.

Open Notebook empowers you to manage your research, generate AI-assisted notes, and interact with your content‚Äîon your terms.

Learn more about our project at [https://www.open-notebook.ai](https://www.open-notebook.ai)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up

Go to the [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP.md) to learn how to set up the tool in details.

You don't need to clone this repo if you just want to use the app without building from source!
Take a look at the [Open Notebook Boilerplate](https://github.com/lfnovo/open-notebook-boilerplate) repo with a sample of how to set it up for maximum feature usability.

### Running from source

Start by cloning this repo and cd into it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lfnovo/open-notebook
cd open-notebook
```

Rename `.env.example` into `.env` and set up your API keys.
Also, repeat the process for `docker.env` if you plan to run this using docker.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp .env.example docker.env
```

Edit .env for your API keys.

To run the source code locally and experiment with the code, you just need to run:

```bash
poetry install
docker compose --profile db_only up
poetry run streamlit run app_home.py
```

If you don't want to mess around with the code and just want to run it as a docker image:

```bash
docker compose --profile multi up
```
